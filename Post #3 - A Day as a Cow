## A Day as a Cow

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a cow for a day? What do they eat? Where do they go? If this hasn’t sparked your curiosity by now, I don’t know what would! Let’s take a little trip to the farm.

As a cow, one thing is certain – hardly any responsibilities! The first thing the girls do every day is get milked at 6 in the morning. Cows love going into the milk barn because milking relieves any pressure they might have in their udder from the milk, and it’s a great time to get attention from whoever is milking! After the cows get through the milk barn, they come out to fresh TMR in the free-stall barn. TMR stands for total mixed ration and is basically a big, nutritious salad for cows.  It contains all of the required nutrients for cows to stay healthy and continue producing milk. When a dairy cow has her calf, she puts every bit of her energy into producing lots of milk. Sometimes this can cause her to lose weight. TMR provides her with all of the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that her body needs to keep her in tip top shape. She will spend up to 6 hours eating throughout each day. Have the kids ever stuck their noses up at a certain food? Try mixing it in with some foods they do like, they’ll never know the difference and still get the healthy benefits! Farmers figured this out and have been mixing TMR ever since.

Alright, the cows are milked out and have full stomachs.  What’s next? Nap time of course!  Cows will spend an average of 10-14 hours resting every single day. Some will be sleeping; however, a lot of the time will be spent chewing cud and simply laying down for a bit.  Cud is basically gum for cows, just a bit different than your typical bubble gum.  It is actually TMR that has been regurgitated and used to chew on throughout the day. After about 60-70 chews, the cow will swallow the cud that she has been chewing on and brings up some more. She will do this hundreds of times throughout the day. It shows the farmer that the cows are relaxed and stimulates the saliva glands on a regular basis. By now, 6 p.m. has rolled around and it is time to get milked again. The cows will stand in the holding pen for a little bit, waiting their turn before actually getting milked. Once they get into the milk barn, it is only about 5-8 minutes before they are headed out to do it all over again!  10-16 minutes working every day and then eating and resting for the rest of the time makes for a pretty relaxed life! It would be a rare lifestyle if any human were to live every day like this; however, once a week is reasonable.  If you’re tired at the end of a long week and just want a break, take a day to simply be a cow!
