## Time to Feed the Calves!

Do you have several kids who make sure you know when their hungry? Imagine having 60 baby calves eager for some dinner!  On the farm we feed calves milk twice a day, and give them access to grain and water throughout the day and night.  The heifer calves (girls) live in little houses with an outside area to play in, while the bulls (boys) get to live in a barn all under one roof.  Twice a day I feed both groups and check on how they are feeling to make sure they stay happy and healthy as they grow up.  The heifer calves get milk replacer which is mixed up right before feeding time.  The milk replacer is high in protein and nutrients which gives the calves a little boost, similar to a nutrient drink or protein shake you would give the kids. 
Once the milk gets mixed up and fed to the calves, I will go through and give them one scoop of grain and a full bucket of fresh water.  Calves love to eat throughout the day just like the kids love their snack time.  Keeping them full around the clock allows them to grow strong before they are moved into their group pens.  After milk, grain, and water is fed, the houses all get bedded with sawdust or straw to make sure the calves stay cool in the summer warm in the winter.
The bull calves get fed milk from the cows that cannot be put into the milk tank.  This milk is primarily from the cows who have just had calves or ones who are getting medicine.  The milk is perfectly fine for the calves to consume; however, people should not drink it due to the antibodies present that are naturally present in cows.  Feeding them the “dump” milk reduces the farm’s waste and provides the calves with natural nutrients from the cow’s milk.  The bulls also get grain and water provided to them 24/7 and are supplied with fresh bedding as they need it. 
After the calves are 6 weeks old they get their milk feeding reduced to once per day.  This process is called weaning, it will slowly train them to eat more grain and rely less on getting full from milk alone.  After a week they are taken off milk completely and begin to eat more grain to fulfill their nutritional requirements.  By now, the calves have grown to about 200 pounds, over two times that of their birth weight! They are now ready to be moved into group pens to continue growing and maturing.  Basically it’s time for pre-school!  In group pens they are able to interact with other calves and build their social skills, just like when you send the kids to school for the first time!  It’s hard to see them grow up so fast but we all know it’s best for them in the end!
