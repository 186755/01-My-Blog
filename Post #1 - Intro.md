# Introductory Post

Welcome to Dairy Gal! Iâ€™ve always wanted to share my stories about what happens on my dairy farm every day, but have never thought of a good way to do it.  Until now! My goal for this blog is to share day-to-day stories on the different activities that go on at my family farm, as well as inform readers about general facts about the dairy industry.  I hope to relate some of these stories to daily activates you might participate in, simply adding an agricultural perspective!  

Twice a day we milk about 300 dairy cows and feed about 60 calves, with numerous other activities in-between to keep the farm running.  I hope to educate you on some of the daily tasks that get completed on the farm.  A lot of people do not know how much is required to maintain a farm-especially dairy! Posts will offer knowledge about how our calves get fed, details about milking cows on the farm, what the different dairy breeds we have offer for production, and many more other general facts about dairy farming.  

Growing up on the farm has taught me hard work and respect for the animals that produce so much for us.  Through my stories and writings, I hope to inform you on how the cows get treated on my farm and many others throughout the country.  Showing that farmers truly care for their cows and build relationships with them.  Angel, Maddie, Rose, Oakleigh, Timber, Taylor, Charlotte, Patches, and Mae are just a few of the cows that I grew up with.  They never failed to listen to my problems and always made me feel better in the end! A couple have passed away due to old age and it felt like losing a best friend.  

Overall, I hope that sharing my stories will encourage laughter and curiosity. Most importantly, after reading one of my posts I have high hopes that you can learn new things and pass that knowledge down to children, family, and many friends!
