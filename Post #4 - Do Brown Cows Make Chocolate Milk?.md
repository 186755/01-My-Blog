## Do Brown Cows Make Chocolate Milk?
### The 7 Dairy Breeds

This has to be one of the oldest rumors in the book and it is still believed to this day! I am here to settle is for good. Do brown cows make chocolate milk? The answer is… NO!! They never have and I am pretty confident in believing that they never will.  The different breeds all contribute something different to the dairy industry; however, none of them can produce flavored milk. There are seven breeds of dairy cows and one is named Brown Swiss. These cows are the biggest breed and are a grayish/brown color. Unfortunately, they only produce while milk; however, there are many different flavors that can be added for taste!  Holsteins are the most recognized and popular among dairy farmers. They produce the highest volume of milk and are generally easy to care for. These black and white beauties are my second favorite breed and know how to make a farmer happy! Ayrshires are primarily known for their colorful spots. They can be mostly white, all red, or anything in between. Most of the time the red and white will be outlined with a blue color due to their skin color change.  This is different from any other breed except Holstein. Jerseys are the second most popular breed because of their ability to produce high levels of butterfat and protein in their milk.  Depending on location, some farms get paid extra premiums for these milk components which makes raising Jerseys a smart choice.  These cows are usually a fawn color and almost always have black around their eyes and nose.  The Guernsey is usually a white and yellowish color. They are known for having a lot of butter fat in their milk which makes butter easy to churn at home. These cows are one of the oldest breeds and were very popular among early farmers. Red and White Holstein is the most recently recognized dairy breed.  Their characteristics are almost identical to a Holstein except for one major difference. They are red and white! Finally, I saved the best for last...  Milking Shorthorn is by far my favorite breed.  These cows are extremely docile and always have the most beautiful colors.  They can range from all red, all white, many combinations of the two, or roan. Roan is special to the Milking Shorthorn breed.  It looks like a perfect mixture of red and white to create a whole new color.  My great granddad was one of the first farmers to raise these cows and has passed down his love for them through every generation.  Each breed has something special that none of the others possess. Every farmer has his favorite and I bet if a breed ever did make chocolate milk that would be everyone’s favorite!
